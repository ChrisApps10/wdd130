        <p> Hello there! My name is Chris Aparicio and I'm from Southern California. My hobbies include biking, repairing old tech, playing retro/modern games, spending time with my family, and learning more about new modern technology. I'm currently studying Software Development at BYU Pathway and have been enjoying every moment of it.</p>

        <p>California is a Western U.S. state located next to the Pacific Ocean. It was admitted to the Union on September 9, 1850 as the 31st state. It is currently the largest state by population with almost 40 million residents. The state is also the third-largest in area size (163,696 sq mi or 423,970 km^2). If California was an independent country, it would be the fourth-largest economy in the world. This is partly due to its estimated gross state product of $4.172 trillion as of Q4 2024.</p>
